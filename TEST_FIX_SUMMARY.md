# Frontend Test Fix Summary

## Issue
The frontend tests were failing after integrating the search functionality with the recipe-search-db worker.

## Root Cause
The tests were mocking the fetch responses with an incorrect format. The `fetchRecipes` function expects the API to return:
```javascript
{ success: true, recipes: [...] }
```

But the tests were mocking it to return just an array:
```javascript
[...]
```

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated VideoPopup.test.jsx**
- Created a helper function `createMockFetch` to consistently mock fetch responses
- Updated all test cases to use the correct response format for the recipes endpoint
- Added proper mocking for the health endpoint

### 2. **Updated AppClippingCore.test.jsx**
- Updated all fetch mocks to return `{ success: true, recipes: [...] }` format
- Fixed the expected alert message from "Recipe saved successfully!" to "Recipe saved successfully to KV storage!"

### 3. **Updated setupTests.js**
- Added `VITE_SEARCH_DB_URL` environment variable for the search DB worker

## Key Fixes

1. **Response Format**: Changed from returning array directly to returning an object with `success` and `recipes` properties
2. **Recipe Data Structure**: Ensured recipes are wrapped in a data property: `{ id: 1, data: { ...recipeData } }`
3. **Environment Variables**: Added missing search DB URL environment variable
4. **Alert Message**: Updated test expectation to match actual alert message

## Result
All 16 tests now pass successfully, maintaining the existing functionality while supporting the new search integration.

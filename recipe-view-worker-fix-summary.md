# Recipe View Worker Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The recipe view worker was returning "Recipe not found" for all recipes, even though the recipes existed in the database.

## Root Cause

The recipe-save-worker returns recipe data in a nested structure:
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "url": "...",
  "data": {
    "name": "Recipe Name",
    "ingredients": [...],
    "instructions": [...]
    // ... actual recipe fields
  },
  "scrapedAt": "...",
  "version": "..."
}
```

However, the recipe-view-worker was expecting the recipe fields at the top level.

## Solution

Modified `/workspace/recipe-view-worker/src/index.js` to extract the nested data:

```javascript
// Extract the actual recipe data from the response
// The save worker returns data nested in a 'data' property
const recipeData = recipe.data || recipe;

// Generate HTML page
const html = generateRecipeHTML(recipeData);
```

This change ensures backward compatibility (using `recipe.data || recipe`) while fixing the issue.

## Testing

1. Added a new test case to handle the nested data structure
2. All tests pass successfully
3. The fix has been verified to work with the actual recipe data structure

## Deployment

To apply this fix, the recipe-view-worker needs to be deployed:

```bash
cd /workspace/recipe-view-worker
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## Verified Recipe

The following recipe was confirmed to exist in the production database:
- **Title**: Chicken Stuffed Peppers
- **URL**: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/282482/peppers-stuffed-with-chicken-and-rice/
- **ID**: `61f1a79e93ee23902111b10b14e3ce8ebc27d4fdb5ddf76e8649c352b6d516b7`
- **View URL**: https://recipe-view-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev/recipe/61f1a79e93ee23902111b10b14e3ce8ebc27d4fdb5ddf76e8649c352b6d516b7

Once deployed, this recipe (and all others) will be viewable through the recipe view worker.

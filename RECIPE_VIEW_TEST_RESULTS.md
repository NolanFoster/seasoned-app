# Recipe View Worker Test Results

## Summary

The recipe view worker **does return data**, but there was a configuration issue in the deployed version that prevented it from working with option 3.

## The Issue

1. **Recipe was saved successfully** to KV storage with ID: `65d7ae7464c81a23acb3339d4c018e61421c9a75851d237d5ef19b33693acb4a`
2. **Configuration mismatch**: The view worker was looking for recipes at the wrong domain:
   - Recipe saved to: `recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev`
   - View worker looking at: `recipe-save-worker.recipesage2.workers.dev` (old domain)

## Fix Applied

Updated the fallback URL in `/workspace/recipe-view-worker/src/index.js` line 37:
```javascript
// Before:
const apiUrl = env.RECIPE_SAVE_WORKER_URL || 'https://recipe-save-worker.recipesage2.workers.dev';

// After:
const apiUrl = env.RECIPE_SAVE_WORKER_URL || 'https://recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev';
```

## How to Test

### Option 1: Local Testing (Recommended)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start save worker
cd recipe-save-worker && npx wrangler dev --port 8787

# Terminal 2: Start view worker
cd recipe-view-worker && npx wrangler dev --port 8789

# Terminal 3: Run test
./test-recipe-view.js
```

### Option 2: After Deployment
Once the updated view worker is deployed, the recipe can be viewed at:
```
https://recipe-view-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev/recipe/65d7ae7464c81a23acb3339d4c018e61421c9a75851d237d5ef19b33693acb4a
```

### Option 3: Verify Recipe Data
The recipe data is successfully stored and can be retrieved:
```bash
curl https://recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev/recipe/get?id=65d7ae7464c81a23acb3339d4c018e61421c9a75851d237d5ef19b33693acb4a
```

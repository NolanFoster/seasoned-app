# Recipe Search Improvement: Partial Word Matching

## Problem
The search functionality was not working with partial words. For example:
- Searching for "chick" wouldn't find "chicken" recipes
- Searching for "tom" wouldn't find "tomato" recipes
- This made the search feel broken and unusable

## Root Cause
The search uses SQLite's FTS5 (Full-Text Search) module, which by default only matches complete words. FTS5 tokenizes text into complete words and searches for exact matches of those tokens.

## Solution
I've modified the search functionality in `/workspace/recipe-search-db/src/index.js` to automatically append an asterisk (`*`) to each search term. This enables prefix matching in FTS5.

### Changes Made
In the `searchNodes` function:

```javascript
// Transform the query to support prefix matching
const searchTerms = query.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(term => term.length > 0);
const ftsQuery = searchTerms.map(term => {
  // Escape special characters and add prefix wildcard
  const escapedTerm = term.replace(/['"]/g, '');
  return escapedTerm.endsWith('*') ? escapedTerm : escapedTerm + '*';
}).join(' ');
```

### How It Works
- When you search for "chick", it becomes "chick*" 
- FTS5 interprets "chick*" as "match any word starting with 'chick'"
- This matches "chicken", "chickpea", "chicks", etc.
- Multiple words work too: "pasta sal" becomes "pasta* sal*" matching "pasta salad"

## Deployment
To deploy these changes:

1. Navigate to the recipe-search-db directory:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/recipe-search-db
   ```

2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. The changes will be live immediately after deployment

## Benefits
- ✅ More intuitive search experience
- ✅ Users can type partial words and find recipes
- ✅ Faster recipe discovery
- ✅ No changes needed in the frontend
- ✅ Backward compatible - explicit wildcards still work

## Testing
After deployment, test with queries like:
- "chick" → should find chicken recipes
- "tom" → should find tomato recipes  
- "sal" → should find salad, salmon, salt recipes
- "choc" → should find chocolate recipes

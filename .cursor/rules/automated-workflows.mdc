# Automated Workflows

## Suggest CI/CD Integration:
When implementing features, consider:
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Pre-commit hooks for linting
- Automated staging deployments
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for heavy operations

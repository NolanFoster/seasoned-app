# Release Workflow Guidelines

When performing a release from staging to production (main branch), follow this structured workflow:

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before starting the release process:
1. Ensure all tests pass on the staging branch
2. Verify staging deployment is working correctly
3. Review all changes between staging and main
4. Ensure no active hotfixes are in progress on main

## Release Process

### 1. Prepare Staging Branch
```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to staging branch
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging

# Rebase main into staging to incorporate any hotfixes
git rebase origin/main
```

### 2. Handle Conflicts During Rebase
If conflicts occur during rebase:
- Resolve conflicts carefully, prioritizing staging changes for features
- Keep any hotfixes from main intact
- Test thoroughly after resolution
- Continue rebase: `git rebase --continue`
- If issues arise: `git rebase --abort` and investigate

### 3. Push Updated Staging
After successful rebase:
```bash
# Force push the rebased staging (coordinate with team)
git push origin staging --force-with-lease
```

### 4. Merge to Production
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge staging into main (should be fast-forward after rebase)
git merge staging

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

### 5. Post-Release Verification
1. Monitor deployment pipelines
2. Verify production deployment completed successfully
3. Perform smoke tests on production
4. Tag the release: `git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Release version 1.x.x"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v1.x.x`

## Conflict Resolution Guidelines

When resolving conflicts:
- **Feature code**: Generally keep staging version (newer features)
- **Hotfixes**: Preserve any hotfix changes from main
- **Dependencies**: Merge carefully, may need both versions
- **Configuration**: Review environment-specific settings
- **Documentation**: Merge both sets of changes

## Emergency Rollback

If issues are discovered post-release:
1. Revert the merge commit: `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>`
2. Push the revert: `git push origin main`
3. Investigate and fix issues on staging
4. Re-attempt release when ready

## Important Notes

- **Never force push to main** without team coordination
- **Always test** after resolving conflicts
- **Document** any significant conflict resolutions
- **Communicate** with team during release process
- **Monitor** production after deployment

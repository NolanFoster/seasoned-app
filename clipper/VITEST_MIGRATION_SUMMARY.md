# Vitest Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration of the Clipper project from a custom test runner to Vitest.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- Installed Vitest and related packages:
  - `vitest` - Core testing framework
  - `@vitest/coverage-v8` - Coverage provider
  - `@vitest/ui` - UI for test results
  - `happy-dom` - DOM environment (initially, later replaced with node)
  - `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` - Cloudflare Workers testing support

### 2. Configuration Files
- Created `vitest.config.js` - Main configuration for unit tests with coverage
- Created `vitest.config.workers.js` - Configuration for Cloudflare Workers integration tests
- Removed `.c8rc.json` - No longer needed with Vitest's built-in coverage

### 3. Test Files
- Migrated all test files from custom test framework to Vitest format:
  - Replaced custom `test()` and `assert()` functions with Vitest's `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()`
  - Added proper imports for Vitest functions
  - Renamed test files to use `.test.js` extension
  - Created separate `.worker.test.js` files for Cloudflare Workers-specific tests

### 4. Package.json Scripts
- Updated test scripts:
  - `test`: Runs all tests with Vitest
  - `test:watch`: Runs tests in watch mode
  - `test:workers`: Runs Cloudflare Workers-specific tests
  - `test:coverage`: Runs tests with coverage reporting

### 5. GitHub Workflow Updates
- Updated `.github/workflows/clipper-tests.yml` to:
  - Use Vitest for test execution
  - Generate coverage reports in multiple formats (lcov, html, json-summary)
  - Handle coverage summary display in GitHub Actions
  - Support coverage comments on pull requests

## Coverage Configuration

Coverage is configured with the following settings:
- Provider: V8
- Reporters: text, lcov, html, json-summary
- Thresholds: 10% for all metrics (lines, functions, branches, statements)
- Exclusions: node_modules, tests, demos, docs, config files

## Testing Approach

Due to Cloudflare Workers environment limitations with coverage, we use a hybrid approach:
1. **Unit tests** (`*.test.js`) - Run in Node environment with full coverage support
2. **Worker tests** (`*.worker.test.js`) - Run with Cloudflare Workers pool for accurate worker behavior testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run worker-specific tests
npm run test:workers

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Notes

- Some tests may need adjustment based on the actual implementation behavior
- The Cloudflare Workers pool doesn't support coverage collection directly
- Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory
- GitHub Actions will automatically run tests and report coverage on pull requests

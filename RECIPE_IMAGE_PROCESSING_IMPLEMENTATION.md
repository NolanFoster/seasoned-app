# Recipe Image Processing Implementation

This document describes the implementation of automatic image downloading and saving to R1 (Cloudflare R2) storage when recipes are scraped.

## Implementation Overview

The image processing functionality has been successfully implemented across several components:

### 1. R2 Bucket Configuration

**File**: `recipe-scraper/wrangler.toml`

Added R2 bucket binding:
```toml
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "RECIPE_IMAGES"
bucket_name = "recipe-images"

[vars]
IMAGE_DOMAIN = "https://recipe-images.your-domain.com"
```

### 2. Image Service Module

**File**: `shared/image-service.js`

Created a comprehensive image service with the following functions:

- `downloadImage(imageUrl)` - Downloads images from URLs with validation
- `uploadImageToR2(r2Bucket, imageBuffer, filename, contentType, baseUrl)` - Uploads images to R2
- `saveRecipeImageToR2(r2Bucket, imageUrl, baseUrl)` - Complete workflow for saving images
- `processRecipeImages(r2Bucket, imageUrls, baseUrl)` - Handles single or multiple images
- `generateImageFilename(originalUrl, extension)` - Generates unique filenames
- `getImageExtension(url, contentType)` - Determines image file extensions

**Key Features**:
- Supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- File size validation (max 10MB)
- Content type validation
- Timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Graceful error handling (continues recipe processing if image fails)
- Unique filename generation with timestamps and hashes

### 3. Recipe Scraper Integration

**File**: `recipe-scraper/worker.js`

Modified the `processRecipeUrl` function to:

1. Extract recipe data including image URLs
2. Download and save images to R2 if bucket is available
3. Replace original image URLs with R2 URLs
4. Preserve original image URLs in `originalImageUrl` field
5. Continue processing even if image processing fails

**Key Changes**:
```javascript
// Process and save recipe image to R2 if available
if (r2Bucket && recipeData.image) {
  try {
    const originalImageUrl = recipeData.image;
    const processedImageUrl = await processRecipeImages(r2Bucket, recipeData.image, imageBaseUrl);
    if (processedImageUrl && processedImageUrl !== originalImageUrl) {
      recipeData.image = processedImageUrl;
      recipeData.originalImageUrl = originalImageUrl;
    }
  } catch (imageError) {
    console.error(`Failed to process image for recipe ${url}:`, imageError.message);
    // Continue with original image URL if processing fails
  }
}
```

## Testing Implementation

### 1. Unit Tests

**File**: `shared/test-image-service.js`

Comprehensive unit tests covering:
- ✅ Image filename generation
- ✅ File extension detection
- ✅ Image downloading with various scenarios
- ✅ R2 upload functionality
- ✅ Error handling for network failures
- ✅ File size and content type validation
- ✅ Multiple image processing
- ✅ Integration workflow testing

**Run tests**:
```bash
cd shared
npm run test:image
```

**Test Results**: All 24 tests passing ✅

### 2. Integration Tests

**File**: `recipe-scraper/test-image-processing.js`

Tests for the complete recipe scraping workflow with image processing:
- Recipe image processing when R2 bucket is available
- Handling recipes without images
- Graceful error handling when image processing fails
- Preserving original URLs when processing returns same URL

## How It Works

1. **Recipe Scraping**: When a recipe URL is processed, the scraper extracts JSON-LD data including image URLs

2. **Image Detection**: If an image URL is found and R2 bucket is configured, the image processing begins

3. **Image Download**: The system downloads the image with proper validation:
   - Checks content type is an image
   - Validates file size (max 10MB)
   - Handles timeouts (30 seconds)

4. **File Processing**: 
   - Generates unique filename using timestamp and URL hash
   - Determines proper file extension from content type or URL

5. **R2 Upload**: Uploads the image to R2 with proper metadata:
   - Sets correct content type
   - Adds cache headers (1 year cache)
   - Returns public URL

6. **URL Replacement**: Updates the recipe data:
   - Replaces `image` field with R2 URL
   - Stores original URL in `originalImageUrl` field

7. **Error Handling**: If any step fails:
   - Logs the error
   - Continues with original image URL
   - Recipe processing is not interrupted

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set in `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[vars]
IMAGE_DOMAIN = "https://your-r2-domain.com"
```

### R2 Bucket Setup

1. Create R2 bucket named "recipe-images"
2. Configure public access (optional)
3. Set up custom domain for public URLs
4. Update `IMAGE_DOMAIN` variable

## Usage Examples

### Basic Recipe Scraping with Image Processing

```bash
# Scrape recipe and save images to R2
curl "https://your-worker.workers.dev/scrape?url=https://example.com/recipe&save=true"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "success": true,
      "url": "https://example.com/recipe",
      "data": {
        "name": "Delicious Recipe",
        "image": "https://recipe-images.your-domain.com/recipe-images/1234567890000-abcdef1234567890.jpg",
        "originalImageUrl": "https://example.com/original-image.jpg",
        // ... other recipe data
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-worker.workers.dev/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "urls": [
      "https://example.com/recipe1",
      "https://example.com/recipe2"
    ],
    "save": true
  }'
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Images are served from Cloudflare's global CDN
2. **Reliability**: Images won't break if original sites go down
3. **Consistency**: All recipe images have consistent URLs and caching
4. **Cost-Effective**: R2 storage is very affordable for images
5. **Scalability**: Handles multiple images and large batches efficiently

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Network Failures**: Timeouts, DNS errors, connection issues
2. **Invalid Images**: Non-image content, corrupted files
3. **Large Files**: Files exceeding 10MB limit
4. **R2 Failures**: Upload errors, bucket unavailable
5. **Missing Images**: Recipes without image URLs

In all error cases, the system:
- Logs detailed error information
- Continues with original image URL
- Does not interrupt recipe processing
- Maintains system stability

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logs

The system provides detailed logging for:
- Image download attempts
- R2 upload operations  
- Error conditions with context
- Processing statistics

### Metrics

Track these metrics for monitoring:
- Image processing success rate
- Average processing time
- R2 storage usage
- Error frequencies by type

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All image URLs are validated
2. **Content Type Checking**: Only image files are processed
3. **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size
4. **Timeout Protection**: 30-second download timeout
5. **Error Isolation**: Image failures don't affect recipe processing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Image Optimization**: Resize/compress images during upload
2. **Multiple Formats**: Generate WebP versions for better performance
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Avoid storing identical images multiple times
4. **Batch Processing**: Optimize for processing many images simultaneously
5. **Analytics**: Track image processing metrics and performance

## Build Status

✅ **Build Issue Resolved**: The original build failure due to Node.js `crypto` import has been fixed by migrating to the Web Crypto API, which is natively supported in Cloudflare Workers.

**Build Success**: 
```
Total Upload: 23.59 KiB / gzip: 5.60 KiB
Your Worker has access to the following bindings:
- env.RECIPE_STORAGE    KV Namespace            
- env.RECIPE_IMAGES     R2 Bucket               
- env.IMAGE_DOMAIN      Environment Variable    
```

## Conclusion

The recipe image processing implementation is complete and production-ready. It provides:

- ✅ Automatic image downloading and R2 storage
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ URL replacement in recipe data
- ✅ Web Crypto API compatibility for Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ Build success with R2 bucket bindings
- ✅ Graceful degradation on failures
- ✅ Scalable architecture

**Status**: ✅ **Ready for Deployment**

The system successfully builds and deploys to Cloudflare Workers and will significantly improve the reliability and performance of recipe image handling.

# Recipe Scraper Test Coverage Report

## Summary

Test coverage has been significantly improved for the recipe-scraper worker:

### Current Coverage
- **Statements**: 80.79%
- **Branches**: 84.57% 
- **Functions**: 100%
- **Lines**: 79.61%

### What Was Done

1. **Set up Jest testing framework** with coverage reporting and proper configuration for ES modules and Cloudflare Workers environment

2. **Created comprehensive unit tests** for all utility functions:
   - `decodeHtmlEntities` - HTML entity decoding
   - `normalizeIngredients` - Ingredient data normalization
   - `normalizeInstructions` - Instruction data normalization  
   - `isRecipeType` - Recipe type validation
   - `validateRecipeSchema` - Schema validation
   - `extractRecipeData` - Data extraction from JSON-LD

3. **Created tests for complex components**:
   - `JSONLDExtractor` class - Handles parsing of JSON-LD scripts
   - `processRecipeUrl` - Main scraping logic (limited by HTMLRewriter API)

4. **Created integration tests** for the fetch handler covering:
   - Health endpoint
   - CORS handling
   - GET/POST /scrape endpoints
   - GET/DELETE /recipes endpoints
   - Error handling

5. **Added edge case tests** to improve coverage of:
   - Null/undefined handling
   - Array vs object handling
   - Nested data structures
   - Missing optional fields

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Cloudflare Worker APIs**: The worker uses Cloudflare-specific APIs like `HTMLRewriter` which are not available in the Node.js test environment, limiting our ability to fully test the scraping functionality.

2. **Module mocking**: The complex module structure with shared dependencies made it challenging to properly mock all dependencies.

3. **Integration test limitations**: Some integration tests fail due to the mismatch between the test environment and actual Cloudflare Worker environment.

### Recommendations

To achieve 85%+ coverage:

1. **Refactor for testability**: Consider extracting the core logic that doesn't depend on Cloudflare APIs into separate, testable functions.

2. **Use Miniflare v3+**: Upgrade to a newer version of Miniflare that better supports Cloudflare Worker APIs like HTMLRewriter.

3. **Mock at a higher level**: Instead of mocking individual functions, consider mocking entire HTTP responses to test the full flow.

4. **Add E2E tests**: Deploy to a test environment and run actual end-to-end tests against the deployed worker.

### Test Files Created

- `worker.test.js` - Main unit tests
- `worker.fetch.test.js` - Fetch handler tests  
- `worker.integration.test.js` - Integration tests
- `worker.additional.test.js` - Additional coverage tests
- `worker.edge-cases.test.js` - Edge case tests
- `worker.final.test.js` - Final coverage improvements

Despite not quite reaching the 85% threshold due to environment constraints, the test suite now provides substantial coverage of the core logic and will help catch regressions during future development.

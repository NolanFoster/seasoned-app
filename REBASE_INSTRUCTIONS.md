# Manual Instructions: Rebase Main into Staging and Push to Main

Since the terminal is unresponsive, please follow these manual steps in your local terminal:

## Steps to Execute

1. **Fetch latest changes from remote:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Switch to staging branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   ```

3. **Pull latest staging changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin staging
   ```

4. **Rebase main into staging:**
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

   If there are conflicts:
   - Resolve the conflicts in the affected files
   - Stage the resolved files: `git add <resolved-files>`
   - Continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`
   - Or abort if needed: `git rebase --abort`

5. **Push the rebased staging to main:**
   ```bash
   git push origin staging:main --force-with-lease
   ```

   Note: `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force` as it will fail if someone else has pushed to main since you last fetched.

## Alternative: Using the Script

You can also run the script I created:
```bash
chmod +x /workspace/rebase_and_push.sh
./rebase_and_push.sh
```

## Important Notes

- This operation will rewrite the main branch history with the rebased staging branch
- Make sure no one else is working on main during this operation
- Consider creating a backup branch before proceeding:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git checkout -b main-backup
  ```

## Verification

After completing, verify the result:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git log --oneline -10
```

This should show the staging commits rebased on top of the previous main commits.

# Recipe View Worker Debug Summary

## Current Status

The recipe view worker is functioning correctly, but it cannot find any recipes in the KV storage.

## Key Findings

1. **Workers are deployed and accessible:**
   - Production Save Worker: `https://recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev` ✓
   - Production View Worker: `https://recipe-view-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev` ✓
   - Staging Save Worker: `https://staging-recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev` ✓
   - Staging View Worker: Not deployed (404)

2. **Recipe ID Generation:**
   - Recipe IDs are SHA-256 hashes of the recipe URL
   - Example: `https://example.com/recipe` → `3f3d15bc0d190a81cd31a05e04f3db27dcd3e3fcd8402a7b9f3b962b3ef4ba7c`

3. **KV Namespace Configuration:**
   - Production KV ID: `dd001c20659a4d6982f6d650abcac880`
   - Staging KV ID: `3f8a3b17db9e4f8ea3eae83d864ad518`
   - These are different namespaces!

## Possible Issues

1. **Environment Mismatch**: Recipes might be saved in staging but you're checking production (or vice versa)
2. **Wrong Recipe IDs**: The recipe IDs being tested don't match actual stored recipes
3. **KV Namespace Issue**: The KV namespace might not be properly bound or accessible

## Next Steps

To debug further, we need:

1. **A known recipe URL or ID** that was previously saved
2. **Which environment** (production/staging) the recipes were saved to
3. **When the recipes were saved** (to check if they might have expired)

## How to Test with a Known Recipe

If you have a recipe URL that was saved:

```javascript
// Generate the ID from the URL
const crypto = require('crypto');
const url = 'YOUR_RECIPE_URL_HERE';
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(url).digest('hex');
console.log('Recipe ID:', hash);

// Then test with:
// https://recipe-view-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev/recipe/{hash}
```

## Alternative Debugging Approaches

1. **Check KV directly** (requires Wrangler authentication):
   ```bash
   wrangler kv:key list --namespace-id=dd001c20659a4d6982f6d650abcac880
   ```

2. **Create a test recipe** to verify the system works:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev/recipe/save \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "recipe": {
         "url": "https://test.com/my-test-recipe",
         "title": "Test Recipe",
         "ingredients": ["1 test"],
         "instructions": ["Test step"]
       }
     }'
   ```

3. **Check if recipes are in the wrong environment**:
   - If saved to staging, use staging URLs
   - If saved to production, use production URLs

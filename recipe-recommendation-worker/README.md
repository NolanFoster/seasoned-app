  "services": {
    "ai": "healthy"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "uptime": 1000,
    "totalRequests": 150

```

### `GET /metrics`

Real-time metrics endpoint for monitoring and observability.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "requestId": "req_1642248600000_abc123def",
  "metrics": {
    "requests_total": {"count": 100},
    "request_duration": {"count": 95, "avg": 131.58, "min": 89, "max": 450},
    "ai_requests": {"count": 85},
    "ai_success": {"count": 80}
  },
  "summary": {
    "totalMetrics": 25,
    "uptime": 3600000
  }
}
```

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Note: The AI binding will be automatically configured by Wrangler.

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   
   The worker will automatically use Cloudflare's Workers AI - no API keys needed!

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for recommendation logic
- API endpoint tests
- Season detection tests
- Mock data validation
- Error handling tests

## Observability

This worker includes comprehensive observability features for production monitoring:

### Key Features
- **Structured JSON logging** with consistent fields across all operations
- **Request tracking** with unique IDs for end-to-end tracing
- **Performance metrics** including AI model response times and parsing duration
- **Error categorization** for better debugging and alerting
- **Cloudflare Analytics integration** for usage patterns and performance analysis
- **Health monitoring** with service status checks
- **Real-time metrics endpoint** for monitoring dashboards

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Service health with AI binding status
- `GET /metrics` - Real-time performance metrics

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View real-time logs
npm run logs

# Filter error logs
wrangler tail | jq 'select(.level == "error")'

# Monitor AI performance
wrangler tail | jq 'select(.message | contains("AI")) | {requestId, duration, model}'
```

For detailed observability documentation, see [OBSERVABILITY.md](./OBSERVABILITY.md).

## Architecture

The worker uses:
- **Cloudflare Workers AI** with Llama 3.1 8B model for generating contextual recommendations
- **Fallback mock data** for reliability when AI is unavailable
- **Edge deployment** for low latency worldwide
- **Analytics Engine** for metrics collection and analysis
- **No external API dependencies** - runs entirely on Cloudflare's infrastructure

## How It Works

1. Receives location and date from the client
2. Determines the season based on the date
3. Constructs a prompt with location, date, and seasonal context
4. Calls Cloudflare Workers AI to generate relevant recipe categories and tags
5. Falls back to curated seasonal recommendations if AI fails
6. Returns structured JSON with categorized recipe tags

## Mock Data

When Cloudflare AI is not available, the worker returns curated recommendations based on season:

- **Spring**: Fresh herbs, asparagus, strawberries, salads
- **Summer**: BBQ items, tomatoes, corn, refreshing dishes
- **Fall**: Pumpkin, apples, comfort foods, warm spices
- **Winter**: Citrus, hearty soups, holiday favorites

## Environment Variables

No environment variables required! The worker uses Cloudflare's built-in AI binding.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run tests

```

## CI/CD Workflow Updates

### GitHub Actions Workflow Changes

1. **Added Coverage Extraction Step**
   - Extracts coverage percentages from vitest output
   - Checks if coverage meets 80% thresholds
   - Always runs with `always()` condition

2. **Added PR Comment Step**
   - Posts coverage report as a comment on PRs
   - Shows coverage metrics in a table format
   - Indicates pass/fail status for each metric
   - Always posts comment even if coverage is below threshold
   - Updates existing comment if one exists

3. **Added continue-on-error**
   - Test coverage step continues even if thresholds fail
   - Allows coverage report to be generated and posted
   - Final check step determines if job should fail

### Key Features

- Coverage reports are **always posted** on PRs regardless of threshold status
- Clear visual indicators (✅/❌) for each metric
- Helpful message when coverage is below threshold
- Coverage data is preserved in workflow artifacts
- Compatible with existing Codecov integration

## Configuration Updates

1. **vitest.config.js**
   - Added `thresholdAutoUpdate: false` to prevent automatic threshold updates
   - Maintains 80% threshold requirements

2. **Workflow Conditions**
   - Uses `always()` condition for coverage-related steps
   - Ensures coverage report is posted even when tests fail

## Usage

The coverage improvements are automatically applied when:
1. Running tests locally: `npm run test:coverage`
2. Creating or updating a pull request
3. Pushing to main or staging branches

Coverage reports will appear as comments on pull requests with detailed metrics and status indicators.

# Differential Coverage Report Fix Summary

## Problem
The differential coverage report on pull requests was showing "no code changes were made" despite actual code changes being present.

## Root Causes
1. **Branch fetching issue**: The base branch might not be properly available for comparison
2. **Path resolution**: diff-cover needs to match paths between the git diff and the coverage report
3. **Diff notation**: Using two dots (..) vs three dots (...) affects how git calculates the diff

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Explicit Base Branch Fetch
Added a step to ensure the base branch is properly fetched:
```yaml
- name: Fetch base branch for diff coverage
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  run: |
    git fetch origin ${{ github.base_ref }}:refs/remotes/origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
```

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
Added debugging output to help diagnose issues:
- Current branch and ref information
- Git log of recent commits
- Available branches
- Git diff summary
- Coverage report structure

### 3. Updated diff-cover Command
Changed from:
```bash
diff-cover coverage/lcov.info \
  --compare-branch=origin/${{ github.base_ref }} \
  --fail-under=85 \
  --diff-range-notation=..
```

To:
```bash
diff-cover coverage/lcov.info \
  --compare-branch=origin/${{ github.base_ref }} \
  --fail-under=85 \
  --diff-range-notation=...
```

Key changes:
- Changed `--diff-range-notation=..` to `--diff-range-notation=...` to use merge-base comparison
- Removed `--src-roots=.` as it should work with default paths when run from the correct directory

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Proper branch availability**: Explicitly fetching the base branch ensures it's available for comparison
2. **Correct diff calculation**: Using three dots (...) compares against the merge-base, which is what you want for PRs
3. **Better diagnostics**: The debug output will help identify any remaining path or coverage issues

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:
1. Create a new branch from staging
2. Make changes to frontend JavaScript files
3. Add or modify tests
4. Create a pull request
5. The differential coverage report should now show the actual coverage of changed lines

## Additional Notes

- The workflow already has `fetch-depth: 0` which fetches full history
- Jest is configured to output lcov format which diff-cover can read
- The coverage threshold for new code is set to 85%

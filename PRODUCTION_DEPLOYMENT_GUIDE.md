   - Tagged release as v1.0.0

2. **Production Environment Configuration**:
   - Added production environments to all `wrangler.toml` files
   - Configured proper resource bindings (D1 databases, KV namespaces, R2 buckets)
   - Created `deploy-production.sh` script for automated deployment

### üîß Manual Deployment Steps Required

Since this is a background agent deployment, manual authentication and execution is required:

#### 1. Authenticate with Cloudflare
```bash
wrangler login
```

#### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Run the automated production deployment script
./deploy-production.sh
```

Or deploy individual components:

```bash
# Deploy workers individually
cd clipped-recipe-db-worker && wrangler deploy --env production
cd ../recipe-search-db && wrangler deploy --env production  
cd ../recipe-save-worker && wrangler deploy --env production
cd ../clipper && wrangler deploy --env production
cd ../recipe-recommendation-worker && wrangler deploy --env production

# Deploy frontend
cd ../frontend && npm run deploy:prod
```

### üåê Production URLs

After successful deployment, the application will be available at:

- **Frontend**: `https://seasoned-frontend.pages.dev` (main branch)
- **Main DB Worker**: `https://clipped-recipe-db-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev`
- **Search DB**: `https://recipe-search-db.nolanfoster.workers.dev`
- **Save Worker**: `https://recipe-save-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev`
- **Clipper**: `https://clipper.nolanfoster.workers.dev`
- **Recommendations**: `https://recipe-recommendation-worker.nolanfoster.workers.dev`

### üîç Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. **Frontend loads correctly** at the production URL
2. **Recipe search functionality** works properly
3. **Recipe clipping** from URLs functions as expected
4. **Mobile carousel** operates smoothly on mobile devices
5. **Recipe recommendations** are being generated
6. **All API endpoints** respond correctly

### üìä Environment Configuration

The production environment is configured with:

- **Production D1 Databases**: Separate from staging for data isolation
- **Production KV Namespaces**: Using production KV store
- **Production R2 Buckets**: For recipe image storage
- **Production Worker Names**: Properly named for production environment

### üö® Emergency Rollback

If issues are discovered after deployment:

```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert -m 1 f8c246f
git push origin main

# Redeploy previous version
./deploy-production.sh
```

### üìù Next Steps After Deployment

1. Monitor application performance and error rates
2. Verify all features work as expected in production
3. Update any monitoring/alerting systems
4. Document any production-specific configuration changes
5. Consider setting up automated deployment pipelines for future releases

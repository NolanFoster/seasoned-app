Leave at least one inch of space between the jars during cooling.  Avoid placing the jars on a cold surface or in a cold draft.  Let the jars sit undisturbed while they cool, from 12 to 24 hours.

              "2 tablespoons butter (at room temperature)"
            ],
            "instructions": [
              "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Pat the room-temperature standing rib roast (prime rib roast) dry with paper towels or napkins.  Smear the cut ends only of the roast with the butter.",
              "Previously Frozen Roast:  If your prime rib roast is frozen, let it thaw completely in the refrigerator.  Remove the roast from the refrigerator about 2 to 4 hours before cooking to let it come to room temperature.  Depending on the size of your roast, the time to come to room temperature may vary. I  can not give you an exact time on this.  Use your best judgment!",
              "Room Temperature:  To cook evenly, the roast must not be cold - let it stand at room temperature, loosely covered, for about 2 to 4 hours.  This time can vary depending on how big or small your roast is.  I can not give you an exact time on this.  If you do not let the roast come to room temperature, if will take longer to cook your roast, your roast won't cook evenly, and you will end up with well-done slices on the end and raw meat in the center.  Use your best judgment on room temperature times!",
              "Do NOT salt the outside of your prime rib roast, as salt draws out moisture from the meat while cooking.  You can use a prime rib rub containing other seasonings if desired, but I find it is not necessary.  I know that some people do salt their prime rib roast before cooking, but trust me and do no salt - the result will be a juicy, delicious roast to serve your family and guests! ",
              "Roasting Pan:  Place the roast, ribs down or fat side up, in a heavy stainless-steel Roasting Pan or other metal roasting pan.  Select a roasting pan that has sides at least 3-inches deep.  (I do not recommend using nonstick pans, as these pans yield fewer of the cooked-on bits that make the tasty au jus juice or gravy.)  The rib bones are a natural rack; you will not need a metal one. ",
              "Cooking Temperatures:  Sear the rib roast for 15 minutes at the higher oven temperature (450 degrees F.), then turn the oven to the lower temperature (325 degrees F.) for the rest of the cooking time.  Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan.  Do Not Cover the roast.",
              "You will want to estimate about 12 minutes per pound of meat for the cooking time. See charts to make it easy to determine Prime Rib Roast Cooking Times.  About 45 minutes before the estimated end of the roasting (bake) time, begin checking the internal temperature (use a good instant-read digital meat thermometer).  Play it safe and start checking early, as you do not want anything to go wrong.  This is even more important if you are adjusting for High Altitude Baking.",
              "If you ignore every other bit of advice I have given, please pay attention to this:  For a perfectly cooked rib roast, invest in a good meat thermometer.   Internal temperature, not time, is the best test for doneness and you do not want to blow this meal!",
              "This is the type of cooking and meat thermometer that I prefer and use in my cooking.  I get many readers asking what cooking/meat thermometer that I prefer and use in my cooking and baking.  I, personally, use the Thermapen Thermometer shown in the photo on the right. To learn more about this excellent thermometer and to also purchase one (if you desire), just click on the underlined:  Thermapen Thermometer.",
              "When checking the temperature of your prime rib roast, insert meat thermometer so tip is in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat or touching bone.  Cook until rib roast reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F. (or your desired temperature). See chart to determine Prime Rib Roast Internal Cooking Temperatures for rare, medium-rare, medium, medium-well and well-done.  Remove from oven, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice.  Do not skip the resting stage.",
              "Residual Heat or Carry-Over Cooking:  Remember, the rib roast will continue to cook as it sets.  The internal temperature will rise to 125 degrees F. to 130 degrees F. (medium rare) in approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  If allowed to rest as long as an hour, the internal temperature will rise even higher.  So, pay attention to how long you let the cooked prime rib roast sit. ",
              "Holding Cooked Rib Roast:  To hold cooked roast until serving time, immediately turn off the oven and leave the door ajar after removing roast.  Let roast sit 15 minutes on the counter and then return roast to the oven, door closed, for up to an hour or even 2 hours for the biggest roasts.  Check the temperature every 15 minutes. If will rise approximately 10 degrees F. at first, then gradually subside.",
              "If Using a Convection Oven:  Using a convection oven can cut as much as 25% off the cooking times listed for the regular oven.  It is also easier for your roast to dry out and cook too much in the convection oven.  Watch the roast carefully and please use a cooking thermometer to know when the roast is done and should be taken out of the oven."

Do not soak the potatoes (that will make them soggy.   Also do not use hot water or you will start cooking the outside and the inside will not catch up).  Dry each potato thoroughly with a clean towel.",

              "Pierce each potato deeply with a fork or sharp knife four (4) times on each side at approximately 1-inch intervals (this will allow steam to escape during the baking).  If you do not pierce the potatoes, they may explode during baking in your oven.  You do not want this to happen as it makes a terrible mess in your oven!",
              "Wrapping the potato in aluminum foil will produce a soft skin (not crispy).  Technically this is steaming rather than baking (as the moisture in the potato remains trapped) and the light, flaky texture will be missing.  The texture of a steamed potato is entirely different from that of a perfect baked potato.  Save yourself the trouble and expense of wrapping potatoes in aluminum foil and serve perfect baked potatoes.  My suggestion is to NEVER use aluminum foil when baking potatoes!",
              "For a crispier potato skin:  Rub the outside of the potato with olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter over the skins.  I like to roll the potatoes in coarse or sea salt after rolling in the oil and before baking.  Place coarse salt onto a small plate.  Roll potatoes lightly in the salt.  The skin is so yummy to eat when baked!",
              "Bake on racks of oven until tender.",

              "The higher the oven temperature, the shorter the cooking time will be and the crustier the skin.  Larger potatoes will take longer to bake.  Bake potatoes along with whatever else you are baking and gauge the cooking time according to oven temperature.",
              "Turn the potatoes over halfway through the baking time to prevent browning of the undersides where they touch the oven rack.",
              "Potatoes are done if tender when pierced with a fork to see if it slides out easily and you can check the internal temperature reaches 210 degrees F.  Use a meat thermometer to test for doneness.  You can also test for doneness by gently squeezing the middle of the potato (using a pot holder or oven mitt).  If it gives in easily to your touch, it is done.",
              "When baked to perfection, remove potatoes from the oven.  Slit across the top with a sharp knife.  Gently pinch (squeeze) in each end of the potato towards the middle (using your thumb and index finger).  The potato will then pop open and loosen the fluffy white interior from the skin.  Be careful as there will be some steam."

Place the salmon fillet in a shallow baking dish and sprinkle each side with 1 tablespoon Pernod, 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.

If you see steam pouring out the sides of the steamer, lower the heat.  Check the salmon by separating the flesh with the tip of a knife and looking at the center.  The center should be medium-rare.  When the salmon is cooked, remove from the steamer to a large bowl.",

Because you will be stirring in the remaining ingredients, you do not want to break up the pieces too much.  Stir in the smoked salmon pieces, shallots, lemon juice, olive oil, and egg yolks.  Season assertively with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon white pepper, since this dish will be served cold.  Fold in the prepared butter/creme fraiche mixture.",

Resist the temptation to over cook your salmon until it \"flakes.\"  Flaking indicates the salmon is becoming dry and overcooked.  If you do not have a good cooking or meat thermometer, please purchase one and use it for cooking all your meats and fish! You will not be sorry!",

Place the lids and rings in a medium-size pan and add enough water to equal 1-inch of water.  Cover and bring to a boil for 10 minutes.  Keep the lids and rings in the hot water until they are ready to be used.",
              "Preparing the blackberries:  Gently wash, stem, and drain the blackberries (removing any stems, cores, dried-up berries, and leaves).  Crush the blackberries with a potato masher, food mill, or use a food processor (If using a food processor, pulse to very fine chop) to lightly crush them.  For best results, crush 1 cup at a time.  DO NOT PUREE.  Sieve all the pulp to remove the seeds.  You can keep some seeds in for effect, but I would not recommend for blackberry jam since the seeds are hard on the teeth.",
              "Making the jam:   Measure the exact amount of sugar and instant pectin into a large pan or bowl; set aside.  NOTE: Reducing sugaror using sugar substitutes other than what&rsquo;s recommended on the Ball website will result in failure for the jam setting up. The Ball recipe allows for Splenda to be used as a substitute with instant pectin. To use less sugar, you must purchase and use the Pectin for Less Sugar or No Sugar.",
              "Add the exact amount (5 cups) of prepared mashed and strained blackberries.  Stir until well mixed, approximately 3 minutes.  It is important to stir the pectin in well.",

Fill to within 1/2 inch of top of jar (this allows to expansion when freezing).  Wipe rim of containers with a clean damp cloth and cover with lids.  Let stand for 30 minutes.  The Blackberry Jam can be enjoyed immediately!",

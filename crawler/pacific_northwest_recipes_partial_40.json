        "Wash salmon filet and pat dry.",
        "In a skillet or frying pan that is 2-inches deep, add 2 cups Vegetable Stock and bring just to a simmer; reduce heat to low.  Add salmon filet, cover, and simmer approximately 8 to 12 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 140 degrees F. (salmon will be slightly opaque in thickest part).  Remember the salmon continues to cook after it is removed from the heat source.",
        "Once the salmon is cooked, place in a large bowl and mince (bones removed and finely flaked) the salmon with a fork; set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, soften the gelatin in the 1/2 cup cold Vegetable Stock.  Stir in the 1 cup boiling Vegetable Stock and whisk the mixture slowly until the gelatin dissolves.  Let cool to room temperature.  Add the minced salmon, mayonnaise, Worcestershire Sauce, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  Fold in the prepared whipped cream.",
        "Transfer the mixture to a large decorative mold or half-cup individual molds.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours. Allow gelatin to set until completely firm, several hours or overnight.",
        "Prepare Cucumber Sauce.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
        "Tips to unmold gelatin:  Before unmolding, dip knife in warm water and run knife around edge of gelatin to loosen.  Dip mold in warm water, just to rim, for 10 seconds.  Lift from water and gently pull gelatin from edge of mold with moist fingers.  Place moistened serving plate on top of mold.  Gently remove mold.",
        "Serve with the prepared Cucumber Sauce.",
        "Makes 6 to 8 servings.",
        "Optional Serving Ideas:",
        "Garnish platter with roasted asparagus spears, marinated artichoke hearts, and deviled eggs.  For individual afternoon tea savories, place the salmon mousse in either a two inch cucumber cup or on a cucumber slice with an added dollop of sauce on top.",
        "Place all the prepared onions and carrots into a large pot.  Cover with water and bring just to a quick boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for approximately 1 hour.  Any longer than an hour and the vegetables will begin to turn mushy and begin to lose all their vibrant flavor.",
        "Remove the pot from the heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain the vegetable mixture through a mesh strainer to remove the vegetables.  Set aside the liquid stock until ready to use.  The stock should be light in color, sweet, and translucent.",
        "To store, pour the strained Vegetable Stock into glass jars and refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze.",
        "Yields 4 cups of vegetable stock.",
        "In a large bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, chives or dill weed, parsley, salt, pepper, and onion powder.  Add the grated cucumber and blend together.",
        "Cover and place in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.",
        "Makes approximately 3 cups."

        "Top with the nori sheet (cutting to fit if necessary).  Add the remaining prepared sushi rice, patting it firmly to an even thickness.  Invert onto a serving platter and, using a very sharp knife, cut into 16 squares.  NOTE: Wipe your knife after each cut and dip into cold water. Sprinkle the top with sesame seeds.",

        "In a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the rice and water; bring just to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Turn off heat and let rice rest, covered, for 15 additional minutes.  When rice is done cooking and resting, transfer to a large bowl; loosen rice grains gently with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon by cutting and folding (do not stir, as this will crush the rice).  NOTE: Either use the rice soon after preparing it, or cover it with a damp cloth to keep it moist. Do not refrigerate the cooked rice.",
        "Sprinkle the cooled rice vinegar mixture over the rice, mixing together as you sprinkle (add enough dressing to coat the rice but not make it damp - you may not need to use all the vinegar dressing).  Spread the hot rice on top of a large sheet of aluminum foil and let cool."

        "My husband cleaned the trout just after he caught them by gutting them, cutting off the gills, and most importantly, scraping off the blood line off the backbone.  I also want the head cut off!",
        "First you need to cut the head off just before the Pectoral fin (this fin can be nipped off or left on).  This is an optional step, as some people want the head left on when cooking.",
        "Hold fish with belly facing up. Using your fillet knife, cut from the anal hole forward towards where the head was or still is.",
        "After pulling out the entrails, take an old tooth brush and clean the blood vein that runs along the spine.  If that is not cleaned out it, will effect the taste.",
        "Rinse the trout thoroughly (inside and out) and prepare to cook as you wish.",
        "NOTE: If you like to eat the fish skin, make sure you remove all the fish scales before cooking.  With the trout held firmly by the tail, scrape very firmly from the tail to the gills several times on both sides with a sharp knife.  I, personally, like to have my trout scaled before cooking.",
        "When ready to cook, rinse the cleaned fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Drying will prevent the fish from steaming when you cook it.  Cut a few diagonal slashes along each side of the fish.",
        "Brush the inside and outside of the trout with a little olive oil.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on the inside and outside of the trout.  If you desire, you can also stuff the inside cavity of the trout with lemons or lime slices.",
        "Prepare aluminum foil into approximately 16 by 16-inches squares.  Prepare individual foil squares for each trout to be cooked.  Either spray aluminum foil with non-stick spray or use the non-stick aluminum foil (dull side toward the trout).",
        "Making sure that the trout are in the middle of each square, fold up the aluminum foil loosely, grabbing at the edges and crimping together tightly to make a packet.  You can prepare the fish and make the foil packets several hours ahead.  Keep in the refrigerator until shortly before cooking."

        "Preparing Pork Shoulder:  Rinse and pat dry the pork shoulder.  Cut the pork shoulder into large 3-inch cubes of meat and sprinkle with salt.  Add the pork cubes to the bowl of prepared Mojo Sauce and immerse meat in the marinade.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to marinade for at least 4 hours or overnight.  Remove pork from refrigerator 30 minutes before ready to cook to bring meat to room temperature.",
        "Dutch Oven Instructions:",
        "Place Dutch oven on stove over medium-high heat.  Add 1/4 olive oil to Dutch oven. Once olive oil is heated, add pork cubes (reserving the marinade) and cook until meat is browned on all sides.  May have to cook in 2 to 3 batches to make sure meat is not overcrowded for faster browning.  As each batch of pork is browned, remove pork from heat and set aside.  Once all pork is browned, add all pork back to Dutch oven and pour remaining Mojo marinade over the pork.",
        "Cook until marinade just starts to boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cover Dutch oven with lid. Cook meat on stove for 2 hours, lifting lid and stirring occasionally to rotate pork in marinade or until pork is fall apart tender.  Using forks, pull pork into smaller strands and stir together with the marinade until completely combined and flavor is evenly distributed throughout pork.  Add additional salt to taste.",
        "Slow Cooker (Crock Pot) Instructions:",
        "Preheat Slow Cooker on high heat.  Place pork cubes and all the Mojo Sauce marinade into the slow cooker.  Cover with lid and turn slow cooker down to low heat.  Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or until pork is fall apart tender.  If cooking on high heat, cook 4 to 5 hours or until pork is fall apart tender.",
        "Using two forks in a motion that is pulling away from each other to separate the meat into smaller strands and stir together with the marinade until completely combined and flavor is evenly distributed throughout pork.  Add additional salt to taste.",

        "Serve pork over rice and black beans (see instructions for Cuban flavored black beans below) and garnish with fresh cilantro and shredded cheese.  Serve pork with Cuban Sandwich.",

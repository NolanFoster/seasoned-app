        "Wash salmon filet and pat dry.",
        "In a skillet or frying pan that is 2-inches deep, add 2 cups Vegetable Stock and bring just to a simmer; reduce heat to low.  Add salmon filet, cover, and simmer approximately 8 to 12 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 140 degrees F. (salmon will be slightly opaque in thickest part).  Remember the salmon continues to cook after it is removed from the heat source.",
        "Once the salmon is cooked, place in a large bowl and mince (bones removed and finely flaked) the salmon with a fork; set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, soften the gelatin in the 1/2 cup cold Vegetable Stock.  Stir in the 1 cup boiling Vegetable Stock and whisk the mixture slowly until the gelatin dissolves.  Let cool to room temperature.  Add the minced salmon, mayonnaise, Worcestershire Sauce, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  Fold in the prepared whipped cream.",
        "Transfer the mixture to a large decorative mold or half-cup individual molds.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours. Allow gelatin to set until completely firm, several hours or overnight.",
        "Prepare Cucumber Sauce.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
        "Tips to unmold gelatin:  Before unmolding, dip knife in warm water and run knife around edge of gelatin to loosen.  Dip mold in warm water, just to rim, for 10 seconds.  Lift from water and gently pull gelatin from edge of mold with moist fingers.  Place moistened serving plate on top of mold.  Gently remove mold.",
        "Serve with the prepared Cucumber Sauce.",
        "Makes 6 to 8 servings.",
        "Optional Serving Ideas:",
        "Garnish platter with roasted asparagus spears, marinated artichoke hearts, and deviled eggs.  For individual afternoon tea savories, place the salmon mousse in either a two inch cucumber cup or on a cucumber slice with an added dollop of sauce on top.",
        "Place all the prepared onions and carrots into a large pot.  Cover with water and bring just to a quick boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for approximately 1 hour.  Any longer than an hour and the vegetables will begin to turn mushy and begin to lose all their vibrant flavor.",
        "Remove the pot from the heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain the vegetable mixture through a mesh strainer to remove the vegetables.  Set aside the liquid stock until ready to use.  The stock should be light in color, sweet, and translucent.",
        "To store, pour the strained Vegetable Stock into glass jars and refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze.",
        "Yields 4 cups of vegetable stock.",
        "In a large bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, chives or dill weed, parsley, salt, pepper, and onion powder.  Add the grated cucumber and blend together.",
        "Cover and place in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.",
        "Makes approximately 3 cups."

        "My husband cleaned the trout just after he caught them by gutting them, cutting off the gills, and most importantly, scraping off the blood line off the backbone.  I also want the head cut off!",
        "First you need to cut the head off just before the Pectoral fin (this fin can be nipped off or left on).  This is an optional step, as some people want the head left on when cooking.",
        "Hold fish with belly facing up. Using your fillet knife, cut from the anal hole forward towards where the head was or still is.",
        "After pulling out the entrails, take an old tooth brush and clean the blood vein that runs along the spine.  If that is not cleaned out it, will effect the taste.",
        "Rinse the trout thoroughly (inside and out) and prepare to cook as you wish.",
        "NOTE: If you like to eat the fish skin, make sure you remove all the fish scales before cooking.  With the trout held firmly by the tail, scrape very firmly from the tail to the gills several times on both sides with a sharp knife.  I, personally, like to have my trout scaled before cooking.",
        "When ready to cook, rinse the cleaned fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Drying will prevent the fish from steaming when you cook it.  Cut a few diagonal slashes along each side of the fish.",
        "Brush the inside and outside of the trout with a little olive oil.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on the inside and outside of the trout.  If you desire, you can also stuff the inside cavity of the trout with lemons or lime slices.",
        "Prepare aluminum foil into approximately 16 by 16-inches squares.  Prepare individual foil squares for each trout to be cooked.  Either spray aluminum foil with non-stick spray or use the non-stick aluminum foil (dull side toward the trout).",
        "Making sure that the trout are in the middle of each square, fold up the aluminum foil loosely, grabbing at the edges and crimping together tightly to make a packet.  You can prepare the fish and make the foil packets several hours ahead.  Keep in the refrigerator until shortly before cooking."

(salmon will be slightly opaque in thickest part).  NOTE: During this time the salmon continues to cook (meat temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees after it is removed from the oven) and the juices redistribute.",
        "When cooked, remove pan from oven and allow salmon to cool.  Once salmon has cooled, blot salmon dry with paper towels and remove the skin and discard.",

        "Using your hands, shape the salmon mixture into six (6) equal-size patties. Place the prepared salmon patties on a wax paper lined baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (the cold will firm up the cakes so that they will not break up when fried). I made mine in the morning, covered lightly, and cooked them in the evening.",

        "Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan, and fry the salmon cakes, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until golden brown.",
        "Serve with the prepared Creme Fraiche Sauce and fresh lemon wedges."

        "To cooks, gourmets, and fishermen alike, the salmon is the king of the waters.  The distinctive color of the flesh of a salmon is part of its attraction.  It can vary from a very delicate pale pink to a much deeper shade, verging on red.  In the Northwest, because of the various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, you can find salmon smoked hard in the Indian tradition and salmon smoked light in the Scottish tradition.  It can also be as simple as a barbecued salmon dotted with butter and lemon.",
        "Chum or Dog:  Average size 10 to 15 pounds, up to 33 pounds.  Large flaked, very light in color, low in oil, and is especially suitable for cooked dishes where color is not important.  Male chum salmon develop large “teeth” during spawning, which resemble canine teeth.  This many explain the nickname dog salmon.  It is also said they are called Dog Salmon since they are commonly dried and used for feeding dog teams during winter.",
        "The one cardinal rule in cooking salmon is:  NEVER OVERCOOK SALMON.\n Although it is an oily fish, overcooking makes the flesh dry and dense, and it can become quite chewy in texture.",

        "Place the remaining 1/2 Panko crumbs into a shallow pie plate.  Working with one cake at a time, lightly coat the outside of the crab cakes with the crumbs.  Place onto a baking sheet lined with either parchment or wax paper; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerator at least 3 hours or overnight (the cold will firm up the cakes so that they will not break up when fried).",

The internal temperature should be 150 to 155 degrees F. with an cooking thermometer. Remove from heat.",

I, personally, like to have my trout scaled before cooking.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
        "When ready to cook, rinse the cleaned trout under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Drying will prevent the fish from steaming when you cook it . Cut a few diagonal slashes along each side of the fish.",

        "Bring the aluminum foil up and tightly around the baking dish.",
        "Bake approximately 30 to 35 minutes (depending on the size of your fresh trout). To test for doneness when cooking the trout, insert a fork at the thickest point of the fish.  Perfectly cooked fish is nearly opaque, should be very moist, and will flake easily with a fork.  Fish that looks slightly dry is overcooked.  Under cooked fish will look translucent and raw.  If you have a digital meat thermometer, the internal temperature in the center of the fillet should reach 140 degrees F.",
        "When done, remove from oven, remove from the aluminum foil, and serve on individual serving plates.",

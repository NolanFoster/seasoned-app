        "Wash salmon filet and pat dry.",
        "In a skillet or frying pan that is 2-inches deep, add 2 cups Vegetable Stock and bring just to a simmer; reduce heat to low.  Add salmon filet, cover, and simmer approximately 8 to 12 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 140 degrees F. (salmon will be slightly opaque in thickest part).  Remember the salmon continues to cook after it is removed from the heat source.",
        "Once the salmon is cooked, place in a large bowl and mince (bones removed and finely flaked) the salmon with a fork; set aside.",
        "In a large bowl, soften the gelatin in the 1/2 cup cold Vegetable Stock.  Stir in the 1 cup boiling Vegetable Stock and whisk the mixture slowly until the gelatin dissolves.  Let cool to room temperature.  Add the minced salmon, mayonnaise, Worcestershire Sauce, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste; set aside.  Fold in the prepared whipped cream.",
        "Transfer the mixture to a large decorative mold or half-cup individual molds.  Refrigerate at least 4 hours. Allow gelatin to set until completely firm, several hours or overnight.",
        "Prepare Cucumber Sauce.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
        "Tips to unmold gelatin:  Before unmolding, dip knife in warm water and run knife around edge of gelatin to loosen.  Dip mold in warm water, just to rim, for 10 seconds.  Lift from water and gently pull gelatin from edge of mold with moist fingers.  Place moistened serving plate on top of mold.  Gently remove mold.",
        "Serve with the prepared Cucumber Sauce.",
        "Makes 6 to 8 servings.",
        "Optional Serving Ideas:",
        "Garnish platter with roasted asparagus spears, marinated artichoke hearts, and deviled eggs.  For individual afternoon tea savories, place the salmon mousse in either a two inch cucumber cup or on a cucumber slice with an added dollop of sauce on top.",
        "Place all the prepared onions and carrots into a large pot.  Cover with water and bring just to a quick boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for approximately 1 hour.  Any longer than an hour and the vegetables will begin to turn mushy and begin to lose all their vibrant flavor.",
        "Remove the pot from the heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain the vegetable mixture through a mesh strainer to remove the vegetables.  Set aside the liquid stock until ready to use.  The stock should be light in color, sweet, and translucent.",
        "To store, pour the strained Vegetable Stock into glass jars and refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze.",
        "Yields 4 cups of vegetable stock.",
        "In a large bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, chives or dill weed, parsley, salt, pepper, and onion powder.  Add the grated cucumber and blend together.",
        "Cover and place in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.",
        "Makes approximately 3 cups."

        "After pulling out the entrails, take an old tooth brush and clean the blood vein that runs along the spine.  If that is not cleaned out it, will effect the taste.",
        "Rinse the trout thoroughly (inside and out) and prepare to cook as you wish.",
        "NOTE: If you like to eat the fish skin, make sure you remove all the fish scales before cooking.  With the trout held firmly by the tail, scrape very firmly from the tail to the gills several times on both sides with a sharp knife.  I, personally, like to have my trout scaled before cooking.",
        "When ready to cook, rinse the cleaned fish under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Drying will prevent the fish from steaming when you cook it.  Cut a few diagonal slashes along each side of the fish.",
        "Brush the inside and outside of the trout with a little olive oil.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on the inside and outside of the trout.  If you desire, you can also stuff the inside cavity of the trout with lemons or lime slices.",
        "Prepare aluminum foil into approximately 16 by 16-inches squares.  Prepare individual foil squares for each trout to be cooked.  Either spray aluminum foil with non-stick spray or use the non-stick aluminum foil (dull side toward the trout).",
        "Making sure that the trout are in the middle of each square, fold up the aluminum foil loosely, grabbing at the edges and crimping together tightly to make a packet.  You can prepare the fish and make the foil packets several hours ahead.  Keep in the refrigerator until shortly before cooking."

Remove the meat and measure the water.",

        "To cooks, gourmets, and fishermen alike, the salmon is the king of the waters.  The distinctive color of the flesh of a salmon is part of its attraction.  It can vary from a very delicate pale pink to a much deeper shade, verging on red.  In the Northwest, because of the various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, you can find salmon smoked hard in the Indian tradition and salmon smoked light in the Scottish tradition.  It can also be as simple as a barbecued salmon dotted with butter and lemon.",
        "Chum or Dog:  Average size 10 to 15 pounds, up to 33 pounds.  Large flaked, very light in color, low in oil, and is especially suitable for cooked dishes where color is not important.  Male chum salmon develop large “teeth” during spawning, which resemble canine teeth.  This many explain the nickname dog salmon.  It is also said they are called Dog Salmon since they are commonly dried and used for feeding dog teams during winter.",
        "The one cardinal rule in cooking salmon is:  NEVER OVERCOOK SALMON.\n Although it is an oily fish, overcooking makes the flesh dry and dense, and it can become quite chewy in texture.",

        "After pulling out the entrails, take an old tooth brush and clean the blood vein that runs along the spine.  If that is not cleaned out it, will affect the taste.",
        "Rinse the trout thoroughly (inside and out) and prepare to cook as you wish.",
        "NOTE:  If you like to eat the fish skin, make sure you remove all the fish scales before cooking.  With the trout held firmly by the tail, scrape very firmly from the tail to the gills several times on both sides with a sharp knife . I, personally, like to have my trout scaled before cooking.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
        "When ready to cook, rinse the cleaned trout under cold water and pat dry with paper towels.  Drying will prevent the fish from steaming when you cook it . Cut a few diagonal slashes along each side of the fish.",
        "Place a large piece of aluminum foil in a large baking dish.  Brush the foil with some olive oil.  Place some of the lemon slices on the bottom of the baking dish.",
        "In the cavity of each Rainbow Trout, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and add some lemon slices.  Lay the prepared trout on top of the lemon slices in the bottom of the baking dish.  Lightly rub the top of the trout with some olive oil.  Place additional lemon slices on top of the trout.  Pour the wine around the trout.",
        "Bring the aluminum foil up and tightly around the baking dish.",
        "Bake approximately 30 to 35 minutes (depending on the size of your fresh trout). To test for doneness when cooking the trout, insert a fork at the thickest point of the fish.  Perfectly cooked fish is nearly opaque, should be very moist, and will flake easily with a fork.  Fish that looks slightly dry is overcooked.  Under cooked fish will look translucent and raw.  If you have a digital meat thermometer, the internal temperature in the center of the fillet should reach 140 degrees F.",
        "When done, remove from oven, remove from the aluminum foil, and serve on individual serving plates.",

        "“This evening we were visited by Comowool the Clatsop Chief and 12 men women and children of his nation . . . The Chief and his party had brought for sail a Sea Otter skin, some hats, stergeon and a species of small fish which now begin to run, and are taken in great quantities in the Columbia R. about 40 miles above us by means of skimming or scooping nets . . . I find them best when cooked in Indian stile, which is by roasting a number of them together on a wooden spit without any previous preparation whatever.  They are so fat they require no additional sauce, and I think them superior to any fish I ever taste, even more delicate and luscious than the white fish of the lakes which have heretofore formed my standart of excellence among the fishes.”\n– From the Journals of Captain Meriwether Lewis and William Clark (February 25, 1806)",
        "Tribal chiefs would hold “grease feast . . . in order to destroy the prestige of the rival” chiefs.  The ooligan grease feast was the most expensive of all the feast, “at which large quantities of fish oil (made of the oulachon) are consumed and burnt . . . “During a grease feast, the central fire is built up to the point of scorching the guests in order for the host to conquer them, and “grease is poured into the fire so that the blankets of guests get scorched.”  This serves to raise the prestige of the host who can afford to give such a feast, expending enormous quantities of the valued resource.  If the rival chief is not able to respond with a similar potlatch and destroy an equal amount of property, then his name is “broken” and he suffers a loss of prestige.",
        "Their general recipe is to allow the fish to ripen for approximately two weeks under evergreen branches, cook the fish in fresh water, and then skim the oil from the surface of the water.  Specific recipes differ in the dumping and stirring of the fish, straining the carcasses, placing rocks in the water to reheat the mixture, and filtration methods.  Whatever method used that is unique to the individual tribe, those involved in making the oolichan grease were, and still are, proud of the end product.  The grease was, and still is, shared and sometimes given away as a gift.  The valuable and nutritious end product is used on many foods;  salmon, halibut, herring roe, and  berries, similar to the way butter is used.  The grease was used for trade with other First Nations that did not harvest oolichan.",
        "In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, melt butter; add the smelt and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, turning once, or until fish is lightly browned and flakes readily when prodded with a fork.  Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.",
        "Place smelt on a platter, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve immediately."

        "In a small saucepan, combine Pinot Gris wine and shallots; bring just to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until reduced in volume to approximately 1/4 cup.  Whisk in cream and Dijon mustard; reduce until thick enough to coat a spoon.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add thyme; set aside in a warm place.",
        "Working with one chicken breast at a time, place each between two pieces of plastic wrap with the smooth side down (where the skin used to be).  Working from the center to the edges, gently pound each chicken breast with a meat mallet to 1/2-inch thick.  You want the smooth side to remain intact while the ragged side receives the impact of the mallet.  Since chicken has little connective tissue, it is important to use gentle strokes when pounding the meat can tear easily.",
        "In a shallow pie plate, add flour.  Roll chicken in flour mixture to coat all sides, shaking off excess.",
        "Place lightly beaten egg in a shallow container; dip floured chicken in egg mixture.",
        "In another shallow container, combine chopped hazelnuts and bread crumbs.  Dip chicken in hazelnut mixture to coat evenly.",
        "Melt butter in a sautor frying pan large enough to hold all the chicken breasts in one layer.  Saute chicken breasts over medium heat until golden brown, turning once.  This will take 2 to 3 minutes per side (be careful not to overcook).  Remove from heat and let drain on paper towels.",
        "Meanwhile, bring the Pinot Gris Sauce back up to temperature and whisk in the chopped parsley.  Spoon sauce over each chicken cutlet and serve immediately.",
        "Makes 4 servings."

Tip: With the rest of the pandoro, you can make other finger sandwiches, which can also be filled with robiola and salmon, or with other assorted ingredients. We chose to use robiola with the pandoro because the bread is already very rich in butter. Alternatively, you can make an herb butter: Whip 3-5 tablespoons of butter with a whisk to make it frothy, then mix it with chives and lemon zest. Then spread it on the pandoro and proceed as above.</p>\r\n"

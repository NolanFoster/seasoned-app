# Run the automated production deployment script
./deploy-production.sh

```bash
# Deploy workers individually
cd clipped-recipe-db-worker && wrangler deploy --env production && cd ..
cd recipe-search-db && wrangler deploy --env production && cd ..
cd recipe-save-worker && wrangler deploy --env production && cd ..
cd clipper && wrangler deploy --env production && cd ..
cd recipe-recommendation-worker && wrangler deploy --env production && cd ..

# Deploy frontend

# Search Update Summary: Partial Word Search

## Current Status

The partial word search functionality has been implemented in the code but appears to NOT be deployed to the production Cloudflare Worker yet.

### Testing Results

1. **Full Word Search**: Working ✅
   - Searching for "chicken" returns chicken recipes
   - Searching for "slow" returns slow cooker recipes
   - Searching for "pepper" returns pepper-related recipes

2. **Partial Word Search**: Not Working ❌
   - Searching for "chick" returns 0 results (should return chicken recipes)
   - Searching for "tom" returns 0 results (should return tomato recipes)
   - The FTS query transformation is not being applied in production

## Code Analysis

The implementation in `/workspace/recipe-search-db/src/index.js` (lines 276-284) correctly transforms search queries to support prefix matching:

```javascript
// Transform the query to support prefix matching
// Split the query into words and add * to each word for prefix matching
const searchTerms = query.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(term => term.length > 0);
const ftsQuery = searchTerms.map(term => {
  // Escape special characters and add prefix wildcard
  // Don't add * if the term already ends with *
  const escapedTerm = term.replace(/['"]/g, '');
  return escapedTerm.endsWith('*') ? escapedTerm : escapedTerm + '*';
}).join(' ');
```

This code:
- Splits the search query into individual words
- Adds a wildcard `*` to each word (unless it already has one)
- Enables SQLite FTS5 prefix matching

## Updates Made

1. **Added Version Endpoint** (`/api/version`):
   - Returns version 1.1.0 with partial word search feature flag
   - Helps verify deployed code version

2. **Added Debug Search Endpoint** (`/api/debug/search`):
   - Provides detailed debugging information about search queries
   - Shows FTS query transformation and match counts
   - Helps diagnose search issues

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the partial word search functionality:

1. **Navigate to the search database directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/recipe-search-db
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare (if needed)**:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

3. **Deploy the updated worker**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   # or
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Check version
   curl https://recipe-search-db.nolanfoster.workers.dev/api/version
   
   # Test partial word search
   curl "https://recipe-search-db.nolanfoster.workers.dev/api/search?q=chick&type=RECIPE&limit=5"
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

- `chick` → finds "chicken" recipes
- `tom` → finds "tomato" recipes  
- `sal` → finds "salad", "salmon", "salt" recipes
- `choc` → finds "chocolate" recipes
- `pasta sal` → finds "pasta salad" recipes

## Notes

- The FTS index is already populated with recipe data
- No database schema changes are required
- The implementation is backward compatible
- Frontend code doesn't need any changes

## Troubleshooting

If deployment issues occur:

1. Ensure you're logged into the correct Cloudflare account
2. Check that the worker name in `wrangler.toml` matches the deployed worker
3. Verify D1 database bindings are correct
4. Use the debug endpoint to diagnose search issues: `/api/debug/search?q=YOUR_QUERY`

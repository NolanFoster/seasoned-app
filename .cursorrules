# Cursor Rules

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Pre-commit Hook Setup
**Before making ANY code changes, you MUST install the pre-commit hook:**
```bash
cp .github/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This hook automatically runs tests for all workers and frontend changes, preventing broken code from being committed.

This project uses modular rules stored in `.cursor/rules/`. The following rules are automatically applied:

## Active Rules

1. **Testing and Deployment Workflow** - Ensures proper testing and deployment practices
2. **Code Quality Standards** - Maintains consistent code quality  
3. **Release Workflow** - Guides the release process from staging to production
4. **Pull Request Guidelines** - Keeps PRs focused on production code only
5. **Automated Workflows** (on-demand) - Suggests CI/CD and testing improvements
6. **Cloudflare Worker Setup** (on-demand) - Guidelines for setting up new Cloudflare Workers

## Key Guidelines

### Release Process
- Always rebase main into staging before merging to production
- Resolve conflicts carefully, preserving both features and hotfixes
- Use `--force-with-lease` when force pushing after rebase
- Tag releases after successful deployment

### Development Workflow
- Create feature branches from staging
- Test thoroughly on staging before production release
- Document significant changes and decisions
- Follow semantic versioning for releases

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Never include .md files unless explicitly required
- Exclude one-time operation scripts and temporary files
- Keep PRs focused on production code only
- Use PR descriptions for documentation instead of adding .md files

For detailed rules, see the individual `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`.

**Feature**: Partial Word Search with Prefix Matching

## ✅ Deployment Verification

### Version Check
```json
{
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "features": {
    "partialWordSearch": true,
    "description": "Supports partial word search by appending * to search terms"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Feature Testing Results

### 1. Single Word Partial Searches

| Test Query | Expected | Result | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| `chick` | Find chicken recipes | Found 3 chicken recipes | ✅ PASS |
| `tom` | Find tomato recipes | Found 2 tomato recipes | ✅ PASS |
| `sal` | Find salad/salmon/salt recipes | Found 3 matching recipes | ✅ PASS |
| `choc` | Find chocolate recipes | Found 2 chocolate recipes | ✅ PASS |

### 2. Multi-Word Partial Search

| Test Query | FTS Query Generated | Result | Status |
|------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| `slow cook` | `slow* cook*` | Found 3 slow cooker recipes | ✅ PASS |

### 3. Debug Endpoint Verification

The debug endpoint confirms:
- Original query: `choc`
- FTS query generated: `choc*`
- With wildcard: **2 matches found**
- Without wildcard: **0 matches found**
- FTS index contains **268 rows**

This proves the wildcard functionality is essential and working correctly.

## ✅ Technical Implementation Details

1. **Query Transformation**: Each search term is automatically appended with `*` for prefix matching
2. **SQLite FTS5**: Uses native full-text search with prefix matching support
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing wildcards in queries are preserved
4. **No Frontend Changes**: The feature works transparently with existing UI

## ✅ Performance

- Search responses are returning in < 100ms
- No noticeable performance degradation with prefix matching
- FTS index is properly populated and optimized

## Summary

**The partial word search feature is successfully deployed and fully functional.** 

Users can now:
- Type partial words and get relevant results
- Search more intuitively without needing exact matches
- Find recipes faster with fewer keystrokes

The feature enhances the user experience significantly by making search more forgiving and intuitive.

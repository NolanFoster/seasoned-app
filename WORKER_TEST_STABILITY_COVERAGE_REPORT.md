- **Branches:** 76.44% (threshold: 85%)
- **Functions:** 100% (threshold: 85%)
- **Lines:** 66.48% (threshold: 85%)

**Test Stability:** ❌ **Poor**
- 75/89 tests passing (84% pass rate)
- 14 failing tests across multiple test suites
- 3 test suites failing: worker.integration.test.js, worker.additional.test.js, worker.fetch.test.js

**Common Issues:**
1. **Invalid URL errors:** Missing or undefined `env.SAVE_WORKER_URL`
2. **Mock function errors:** Attempting to mock imported functions that aren't properly mocked
3. **JSON parsing errors:** Non-JSON responses from certain endpoints

**Uncovered Areas:**
- Lines 73-481, 494-507, 535-547 in worker.js
- Error handling paths
- Integration with save worker

## Critical Issues

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Missing `SAVE_WORKER_URL` environment variable causing integration test failures
- Improper mock setup for imported modules
- Connection issues in endpoint tests

### 2. Test Infrastructure
- Clipped Recipe DB Worker tests don't import actual source code
- Mock functions not properly initialized
- Inconsistent test environments between workers

### 3. Coverage Tracking
- Clipped Recipe DB Worker showing 0% coverage despite having test files
- Coverage thresholds not enforced consistently
- Some workers lack coverage configuration

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Fix Environment Variables**
   - Add proper `SAVE_WORKER_URL` configuration to test environments
   - Ensure all required environment variables are mocked or provided

2. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - Recipe Recommendation Worker: Fix location handling when undefined
   - Recipe Scraper: Fix mock function setup and URL configuration

3. **Fix Clipped Recipe DB Worker Tests**
   - Rewrite tests to import actual source code
   - Use proper testing framework (Vitest or Jest with Miniflare)
   - Implement real coverage tracking

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Target 70% coverage for all workers within 3 months
   - Focus on error handling paths and edge cases
   - Add integration tests between workers

2. **Standardize Testing Approach**
   - Use consistent testing framework across all workers
   - Implement shared test utilities
   - Create test data fixtures

3. **Improve Test Stability**
   - Add retry logic for flaky tests
   - Better isolation between tests
   - Consistent cleanup after tests

### Long-term Goals (Priority 3)
1. **Achieve 80%+ Coverage**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests for all API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical workflows

2. **Automated Quality Gates**
   - Enforce coverage thresholds in CI/CD
   - Block PRs that reduce coverage
   - Regular coverage trend reporting

3. **Testing Best Practices**
   - Documentation for writing tests
   - Test templates and examples
   - Regular test review and refactoring

## Conclusion

While the Recipe Save Worker shows reasonable test stability with all tests passing, the overall test coverage and stability across workers needs significant improvement. The most critical issues are:

1. Clipped Recipe DB Worker has no real test coverage
2. Recipe Scraper is failing coverage thresholds with multiple test failures
3. Environment configuration issues causing integration test failures
4. Inconsistent testing approaches between workers

Addressing these issues should be prioritized to ensure code quality and prevent regressions as the project evolves. The recommendations provided offer a clear path forward for improving both test coverage and stability across all workers.
